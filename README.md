## soleus-dehumidifier
A simple library for the soleus dehumidifier. 


## Goal

Produce a library that could be used in homebridge to connect this dehumidifier to humidity sensors all over the house and control the fan/settings accordingly. 

## Status

This project is no longer being maintained after initial upload of code. The dehumidifier broke and I no longer maintain it. If someone wanted to carry it on, you just need to come up with an algo to parse the current status for refreshing state. Most of the setting of state is already done. 


## Testing

I tested inline.. you can do what you want. lol I should say that to come up with the required config values for authentication I used charles proxy to snatch it off my iphone while running the app. It was fairly straight forward.
